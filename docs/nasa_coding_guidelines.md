# NASA Coding Guidelines for Soulsborne Web Game

This document outlines the coding guidelines adapted from NASA's "Power of 10: Rules for Developing Safety-Critical Code" for our Soulsborne web game project. These guidelines are designed to ensure our code is safe, robust, and maintainable.

## 1. Simple Control Flow

- **Rule**: Restrict all code to a simple control flow structure.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Avoid goto statements, setjmp or longjmp constructs, and direct or indirect recursion.
  - Keep loops simple with fixed bounds where possible.
  - Each loop and conditional should have a clear purpose and be easy to understand.

## 2. Fixed Upper Bounds for Loops

- **Rule**: All loops must have a fixed upper bound.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define clear iteration limits for all loops.
  - Avoid infinite loops; use event-driven programming patterns instead.
  - Document the bound for each loop and ensure it's verifiable.

## 3. Dynamic Memory Allocation Restrictions

- **Rule**: Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.
- **Implementation**:
  - Allocate all required memory during initialization phase.
  - Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects.
  - Implement resource management systems for assets.

## 4. Function Size Limitations

- **Rule**: Keep functions focused and reasonably sized.
- **Implementation**:
  - Limit functions to 60 lines of code where possible.
  - Each function should have a single, well-defined purpose.
  - Use descriptive function names that indicate their purpose.

## 5. Error Handling Strategy

- **Rule**: Use a consistent error handling strategy.
- **Implementation**:
  - Check the return value of all non-void functions.
  - Establish a consistent error reporting mechanism.
  - Document all possible error conditions and their handling.

## 6. Restricted Use of Preprocessor

- **Rule**: Use the preprocessor sparingly.
- **Implementation**:
  - Prefer constants and enumerations over #define for constants.
  - Avoid macros that affect control flow or that operate on hidden state.
  - Use include guards for header files.

## 7. Naming Conventions

- **Rule**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
  - Follow GDScript/Godot naming conventions (snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes).
  - Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.

## 8. Documentation Requirements

- **Rule**: All code must be well-documented.
- **Implementation**:
  - Document the purpose of each file, class, and function.
  - Include parameter descriptions and return value explanations.
  - Document assumptions, preconditions, and postconditions.
  - Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes.

## 9. Code Complexity Limits

- **Rule**: Limit the complexity of functions and methods.
- **Implementation**:
  - Keep cyclomatic complexity below 15 for any function.
  - Avoid deeply nested conditionals (maximum nesting level of 3-4).
  - Break complex algorithms into smaller, well-named helper functions.

## 10. Testing Requirements

- **Rule**: All code must be thoroughly tested.
- **Implementation**:
  - Write unit tests for all functions where applicable.
  - Implement integration tests for system interactions.
  - Test edge cases and error conditions.
  - Maintain a high level of test coverage.

## 11. Version Control Practices

- **Rule**: Follow consistent version control practices.
- **Implementation**:
  - Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
  - Make small, focused commits that address a single concern.
  - Use feature branches for new development.
  - Review code before merging to main branches.

## 12. Performance Considerations

- **Rule**: Consider performance implications, especially for web deployment.
- **Implementation**:
  - Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
  - Optimize critical paths for performance.
  - Consider memory usage and loading times for web context.
  - Document performance requirements and measurements.

## 13. Security Practices

- **Rule**: Follow secure coding practices.
- **Implementation**:
  - Validate all user inputs.
  - Protect against common web vulnerabilities.
  - Use secure communication for multiplayer features.
  - Regularly review code for security issues.

## 14. Accessibility Guidelines

- **Rule**: Ensure the game is accessible to a wide range of players.
- **Implementation**:
  - Support keyboard controls alongside mouse/gamepad.
  - Provide options for color-blind players.
  - Allow customization of UI size and contrast.
  - Include options to adjust game difficulty.

## 15. Code Review Process

- **Rule**: All code must be reviewed before being merged.
- **Implementation**:
  - Establish a consistent code review checklist.
  - Ensure at least one other developer reviews all code changes.
  - Address all review comments before merging.
  - Document significant decisions made during code reviews.

By following these guidelines, we aim to create a codebase that is robust, maintainable, and suitable for a high-quality web-based Soulsborne game.
